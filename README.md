## loanwords

Dataset that contains loanwords used in the Albanian language with direct equivalents in Albanian. It's currently
tailored for the [**penda**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/quill) project.

### Getting Started

The dataset is contained in a file named [**loanwords.json**](loanwords.json), evidently in
a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format with a straightforward structure. We are looking to add additional
attributes to the entries, namely **description** and **references** in order to provide more information given a
loanword.

### Contributors

The entries found in this dataset have been manually curated, even though there is still a very low number of them. We'd
like to express our gratitude in the following alphabetical list.
